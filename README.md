by taking the steps below:
* download the libraires using the links provided
* rename the uncompressed folder downloaded by removing "-master" from the name
* place this renamed folder in your \Arduino\libraries folder
				

## EDIT THE CONFIG FILE
	
Include UCW_System file
```	
 #include <UCW_System.h>
```
  
Depending on the communication medium, uncomment the appropriate config struct. BLE connection does not require a struct.
		
WiFi/GSM/Ethernet Struct :   
* provide host-name(server)  
* provide port   
* indicate if connection is secured or not  
* state protocol used (REST or MQTT)  
* provide token for authentication  
  
```
//for WiFi/GSM connections only
static UCWConfig cfg = {
  .host = UCW_API_HOST,
  .port = UCW_API_PORT,
  .isSecuredConnection = false,
  .useMqtt = false,
  .token = "your_token"
};
```
  
LoRa Struct:  
* indicate operating frequency (this varies depending on the your location)  
* provide token for authentication  
  
```
//for LoRa connection only
static UCWConfig_Lora cfg = {
  .freq = RF95_FREQ,
  .token = "your_token"
};
```
    	
Include the library needed by uncommenting accordingly.
 
```	
//WiFi
//set WiFi credentials
#define WIFI_SSID  "your_ssid"
#define WIFI_PASS  "your_pass"
#include "UCW_WiFi.h"
UCW_WiFi ucw(&cfg, WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS);
  
//LoRa			
#include "UCW_LoRa_SUPPORT.h"
UCW_LoRa_SUPPORT ucw(&cfg);
  		
//GSM			
#include "UCW_Mobile.h"
UCW_Mobile ucw(&cfg);
```
  
  
## INCLUDE THE CONFIG FILE
```
#include "config.h"
```
  
    
## WIFI....REST OR MQTT?
  
When using WiFi connection, indicate if communication protocol will be REST-API or MQTT
```
//comment appropriately
 UCW_API_REST ucw_api =  ucw.api();         //REST
 UCW_API_MQTT ucw_api =  ucw.api_m();      //MQTT
```
  
  	
## CONNECT TO THE NETWORK
  
Connect the device to the desired network.
```
 ucw.connect();
```
  	
  
## READING THE DATA
  
Read and collect data from the sensor or any device as defined by the user
The data should be saved in a string variable
  
An example of this step is on reading data from DHTxx sensor is shown in File->examples->UCW Platform Arduino->WiFi->UCWClient_DHT->UCW_DHT
  
  
## RECONFIRM CONNECTION
  
Device connection is reconfirmed before sending data to UCW platform
```
ucw.sys();
```
  	
  
## SENDING DATA TO UCW SERVER
  
Collected data is sent to the server using the method below:
  
The sendData method takes three parameters:
1 deviceID: the unique ID of the monitoring device
2 dataStreamName: name of the data stream
3 payload: the collected data from the sensor or monitoring device
```
// WiFi
ucw_api.sendData(deviceID, dataStreamName, payload);  //REST
ucw_api_m.sendData(deviceID, dataStreamName, payload);  //MQTT
  		
//GSM or LoRa
ucw.sendData(deviceID, dataStreamName, payload);
```
